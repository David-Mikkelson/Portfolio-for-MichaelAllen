### A collection of coding creations by Michael Allen.

I love creating solutions to problems whether it is personal or technical. Learning and coding are a lot like running marathons, its hard work but well worth the reward. Learn more about my professional experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrmichaelgallen). I also have a [blog](http://mrmichaelgallen.com/) about my experience in the development community.
